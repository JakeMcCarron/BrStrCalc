#Calculator
##Desc
MFC based Calculator with variable assignment.

##Things would have done differently
Probably no need for templates or the abstraction of the basic maths functions. Nice to use modules for something though.

##To do/would have done
Add support for longer numbers
Better Pi calc
Add factorial and exponen/power functions to the calculator dlg.
Add support for formulae in the boxes (Box1 : 10x + 10 Box2: 5y). Expressions evaluated and result displayed in result box.
